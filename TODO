URGENT:
  - Memory Management, Memory Management, Memory Management...
    Figure out a way to manage memory properly. Right now a lot of allocation
    is going on in a way that prevents haskell from freeing memory properly.
    As a result probably a lot of memory is leaked...

Tests:
  - Add a test to ensure that fromBool maps True to 1, since the README
    of LibSVM states that is uses exactly this convention.
