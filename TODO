General:
  - Decide whether to make this package depend on 
    http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/logfloat
    so that a correct version of realToFrac can be used.
    Or maybe use the convertible package...
    See the ANN: convertible thread on the haskell mailing list for details

Tests:
  - Add a test to ensure that fromBool maps True to 1, since the README
    of LibSVM states that is uses exactly this convention.
